# Advent of Code 2025

Going back to my C++ roots this year, and checking out what's new since the early days of C++11.

Plain C++ up to and including C++23, no dependencies, simple parallel processing where applicable.

```plain
Usage: make run <task> <input>
 <task>     Day number (two digits) plus part ('a' or 'b')
 <input>    Input file base name, e.g. 'input' or 'sample'
Example: make run 01a sample
```

Profile using `make profile` instead of `make run`.

# Results

The table below shows the average core runtime of each solution, recorded over an average of 20 runs. The core runtime does not include the time it takes to read the input file and split it into lines, but does include any additional input parsing. Reference environment: 2021 MacBook Pro with `clang-1700.3.19.1`.
